# Random Quote Machine

This project was created in part for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification. It is a random quote machine created with React.

The web app displays a quote and its author on the screen. The user can click a button to show a new quote or click the twitter icon to tweet the current quote.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

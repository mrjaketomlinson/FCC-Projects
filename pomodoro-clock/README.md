# Pomodoro Clock

This project was completed in part for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification.

The web app is a customizable pomodoro clock. The user can set the work and break times. Then, once started, the work timer counts down. When the work timer hits zero, a beep plays and the break timer starts. Similarly, when the break is over, a beep plays and the work timer begins.

The project is hosted on Heroku: [pomodoro-clock-js.herokuapp.com](http://pomodoro-clock-js.herokuapp.com/).

To do:
- Clean component code.
- Clean CSS code.

## Here's some info about the pomodoro technique:
"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts."

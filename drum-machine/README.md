# DJ Drum Machine

This project was completed in part to fulfill freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification.

The drum machine allows a user to click on a button, a DJ sound will then play and update the screen with what sound played.

This project is hosted on Heroku: [dj-drum-machine.herokuapp.com](https://dj-drum-machine.herokuapp.com).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

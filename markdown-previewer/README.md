This project was completed in part for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification.

This project is a markdown previewer. In the editor on the left side of the page, the user can enter in markdown text. The previewer shows the markdown output.

You can find this project hosted on Heroku: [markdown-prev.herokuapp.com/](https://markdown-prev.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
